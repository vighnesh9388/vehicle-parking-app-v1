# ðŸš— Park-Karo!
**Park-Karo!** Is a **Parking Lot Management System** that allows users to view availability, search, and book parking spots in a parking lot of their choice, along with their parking history. The app also has a separate dashboard for Admin that allows them to manage lots, monitor spot usage, search lots or users, view user details and analyze revenue/lot statistics.

## Issues Encountered and Fixes

- Replaced hard deletion of parking lots with soft deletion using an `is_active` flag in the `Lot` model to avoid crashes in user reservation history.
- Added `was_occupied` flag in the `Spot` model to prevent deletion of spots that have been previously used, which would otherwise break reservation records.
